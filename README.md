ComputerNetworksBA
==================
This repository is for the course computer networks for Michiel Ariens and Wander Bavin

Although this project consisted of three parts: 
- Write an HTTP server and client
- Network simulations with NS2
- Cisco config

only the first part was committed to github. The others were report based projects.
